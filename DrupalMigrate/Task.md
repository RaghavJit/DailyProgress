# **Migrate Drupal Websites from v7 to v10**

## **Task Overview**

The task involved migrating Drupal websites from version 7 to 10. The objective was to the proper backup of all websites currently running on Drupal7 and extract their contents (Database and site files), and running them in a containerized Drupal10 environment.

---

### **Task Requirements:**
1. **Podman:** Podman was preferred over Docker for security and compliance reasons.
2. **Hosting DB on bare metal:** Database must run on baremetal Podman host, containers should be abel to connect with this DB securely.

### **Proxmox Tools Documentation:**
1. [**Podman CLI Documentation**](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/).
1. [**slirp4netns Documentation**](https://man.archlinux.org/man/slirp4netns.1.en)

---

### **Dockerfile Documentation:**
To understand the functionality of the Dockerfile, please refer to the [**Script Documentation**](./Script.md).

---

### **Prerequisites**

1. **SQL Database:**
The host system must have a **MYSQL** database listening on port 3306 on localhost. The username and password of the database must be known (as it will be passed as build arguments to the Dockerfile).

1. **Slirp4netns:**
Helps the container securely access the host's localhost. 

## **Steps for building**

1. Create database and import dump file.

2. Build the docker image with Dockerfile, 
```
podman build -t <name-of-your-image> . \
  --build-arg REPO=<repository-to-be-containerized> \
  --build-arg PORT=<port-to-host-the-site> \
  --build-arg ENV_DB=<database-for-site> \
  --build-arg ENV_USR=<username-for-database> \
  --build-arg ENV_PSWD=<password-for-database-for-the-username> \
  --build-arg ENV_HOST=10.0.2.2
```

3. Start a container with newly created image
```
podman run -dit \
  --network=slirp4netns:allow_host_loopback=true \
  --cap-add=NET_RAW \
  -p <port-number-to-run-the-site>:80 \
  --name=<name-of-your-container> \
  localhost/<name-of-your-image>:latest
```

This must start the site on specified port in most cases


## **Troubleshooting**
In some rare case, the host specified in the build command **10.0.0.2** might change, this will prevent the database from connecting and site will give out a message like
```
The website encountered an unexpected error. Try again later.
```

To fix this issue we must obtain the correct IP of host that is visible to container inside slirp4netns virtual network namespace.

Drop inside the shell
```
bash exec -it <container-name> bash
```
Install trouble shooting packages
```
apt install mysql-client iproute2 iputils-ping nmap nano
```
Check the container's IP address 
```
ip a
```
Search the subnet for other devices
```
nmap -sn </24 subnet of the container's ip>
```
Look for open port 3306 on suspected IP
```
nmap -p 3306 10.0.2.8
```
If MySQL is running that is your host's virtual IP!
To test mysql connection 
```
mysql -h <ip you obtained> -u <username> -p <database name>
```
